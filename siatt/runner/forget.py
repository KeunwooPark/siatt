"""`forget`: bounded, conservative forgetting. The most cautious job here.

Everything else in Siatt adds or rearranges. This is the one job that removes,
and the design (§6.2) is built around the observation that a memory wrongly
kept costs a little disk and a slightly worse search, while a memory wrongly
removed costs the thing the product exists to do.

**There is no model in it.** The design table lists a utility model beside this
row, and it turned out not to need one: salience is a number, age is a number,
`pinned` is a boolean, and "is anything still linking to this" is a graph
question. Every input to every decision here is already in the corpus, so the
most dangerous job in the system is the one with no judgement in it at all —
which means it can be read, and argued with, and tested exhaustively.

**Two transitions, and the first is mandatory.** A memory whose salience has
fallen below the threshold moves to `memory/archive/`. A memory that has been
sitting in `memory/archive/` past the grace period is `git rm`'d. There is no
path from the first state to the last, and the patch validator refuses a delete
of anything not already archived, so neither this job nor a bug in it can
remove something in one step.

**And a third thing, which is not a memory at all**: stored attachments that
nothing points at any more (#234). This is the only place that may delete them,
because it is the only place that knows what the Markdown still references --
`siatt/store/blobs.py` deliberately never collects. It is also the one deletion
here that git cannot undo. A memory that is `git rm`'d is still in history; a
blob is a file beside the database, and when it goes it is gone. So it is the
most conservative of the three: any memory protects it, archived or not, and
anything that arrived recently is left alone whatever points at it.

**Four things it never touches** among the memories, checked here before
anything is proposed and again by the validator afterwards:

- anything `pinned`
- anything younger than the retention floor
- anything a *live* memory still links to
- more than `max_per_run` files in one week

The last removal is still recoverable: delete is `git rm`, the blob stays in
history, and `forget` runs supervised by default — it opens a pull request
rather than pushing, and somebody reads it before anything leaves the branch.
