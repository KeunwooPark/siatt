"""The durable ingress queue, and the loop that drains it.

Ingress is decoupled from processing (`docs/DESIGN.md` §3.1). An adapter
durably enqueues and acks; a `Dispatcher` leases rows back out and hands them
to a handler. Nothing an adapter does waits on a model call.

Delivery is at-least-once, and deliberately so. The alternative is to mark a
row done before the work happens, which turns every crash into a lost message —
and a chat assistant that silently ignores you is worse than one that answers
you twice. The dedupe that matters is at the *other* end: `UNIQUE (source,
external_id)` means a provider re-sending an event cannot produce a second
answer, which is the duplicate that actually happens in production.
