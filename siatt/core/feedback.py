"""What somebody thought of an answer, and what long-term memory does with it.

The cheapest quality signal there is. A 👍 costs one click and says the thing
no amount of retrieval tuning can work out on its own — that what was recalled
was the right thing to recall. An ❌ says the opposite, and a corpus that
nobody corrects has no other way to find out that one of its files is wrong.

It only works because the answer is still connected to the memories behind it
when the reaction arrives, which may be days later and is certainly after the
process that produced it has forgotten everything. `answers` is that record,
and this module is what reads it back.

The two directions are not mirror images, and the asymmetry is the point.

**Up is a count in a window.** It feeds `salience`, which is recomputed nightly
from age, recall and endorsement rather than adjusted — the property that lets
a bounded pass converge instead of double-counting (`siatt/memory/salience.py`).
Nothing here has to be applied exactly once, so nothing here tracks whether it
was.

**Down is an event, applied once.** It lowers `confidence`, which is not
derived from anything: a number a model set, that nothing recomputes. Treating
one ❌ as a nightly subtraction would walk it to zero inside a fortnight. And
because lowering it is a commit to the repo, an ❌ also raises a review — the
same reasoning as #25's deletions, that a background job quietly rewriting what
a person wrote is what the patch-plan pipeline exists to prevent. The
difference is that here a person is deliberately signalling, so the confidence
change goes ahead through `reflect`'s validated commit; the review is what
makes sure somebody looks at whether the memory should be there at all.
