-- v2: things a person has to look at, because Siatt may not decide them alone.
--
-- The case this exists for: somebody deletes a message whose claim is already
-- a file in the memory repo. Siatt cannot quietly edit the corpus over it — a
-- retraction is not the same as a correction, the file may have been merged,
-- rewritten or built on since, and a background job that silently deletes what
-- a person wrote is exactly the behaviour the whole patch-plan pipeline exists
-- to prevent. So it says so, and stops.
--
-- Deliberately not the `jobs` table. A job is work Siatt knows how to do; a
-- review is work it has decided it should not do. Reusing `jobs` would put
-- rows in it that no handler will ever run and no scheduler should retry.
--
-- `key` is the dedupe. Slack re-sends a `message_deleted` it did not hear an
-- ack for, and three retries of one deletion is one review — the ingress path
-- handles these inline and its idempotence rests on this constraint.
