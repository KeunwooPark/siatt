"""Finding the memories that say the same thing twice.

`promote` writes a memory when the corpus does not already cover a subject, and
"does not already cover" is a judgement made by a model looking at whatever
retrieval put in front of it. It will sometimes be wrong, and the wrongness
accumulates: two files about one person, three about one decision, all of them
true and none of them the place to look.

Finding the pairs is deterministic on purpose. A model deciding what is worth
comparing would cost a call per memory and give a different answer every week;
this gives the same answer every week, can be read in a diff, and is only ever
a *candidate* — whether two memories actually say the same thing is the
question `reorganize` puts to a model afterwards, over the two full documents.

The measure is token overlap, which is crude and has the property that matters:
it never suggests a pair that shares no vocabulary, so a corpus of genuinely
distinct memories costs nothing to check.
