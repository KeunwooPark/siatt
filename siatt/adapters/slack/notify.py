"""Posting into a channel from something that is not a conversation.

`reflect` has a digest to publish and no Slack connection: it is a background
job, not a turn, and the daemon's Socket Mode adapter is a receiver rather than
something a job can borrow. One authenticated POST is the whole requirement.

Plain `httpx` rather than `slack_sdk`, deliberately. `slack_sdk` arrives with
the `slack` extra, and a nightly digest must not be the thing that makes that
extra mandatory for an install talking to Siatt over a terminal. It is also why
this module imports nothing from `app.py`.
