"""The vault — the one place on this machine a secret is allowed to be.

`config.toml` still holds no secrets: it names the environment variable that
carries one, and `docs/DESIGN.md` §11.2 stays true. But an env var only covers
the credentials Siatt is *started* with, and an agent working with a user
acquires authorization mid-conversation — a token pasted into a DM, a key for a
service it was just given access to. Those have nowhere to go today except the
transcript, which is the one place they must never be.

So the vault is not really storage. It is a containment boundary. A value
inside it is:

- known to `siatt.redact.Redactor`, so it is matched exactly rather than by
  shape at every outbound boundary — logs, tool results, recalled memory;
- refused by the memory patch validator, so it cannot reach a commit;
- never rendered into a model prompt.

Everything else in Siatt can then be made to refuse secrets, because there is
somewhere for them to go instead.

**It never leaves the machine.** No commit, no push, no database row, no sync.
Siatt must never ask anyone to put this file in git, and that is enforced here
rather than documented: the vault refuses to load from inside the memory repo,
and `siatt doctor` warns when it is inside any git work tree at all.

Threat model, stated plainly so nobody mistakes what this buys. The file is
plaintext at `0600` in a `0700` directory. That defends against *committed to
git*, *synced to a dotfiles repo*, and *read by another user on the box*. It
does not defend against root, or against someone who already has the ability to
run code as this user — and neither would the alternatives: a passphrase defeats
a daemon that has to restart unattended, and a key file stored next to the
ciphertext is theatre. Better to be honest about the line than to draw it in a
place that only looks further away.
