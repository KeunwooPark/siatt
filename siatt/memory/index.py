"""Building the derived search index from the repository.

The invariant this module exists to preserve: **SQLite is disposable, the repo
is the truth.** `reindex --full` deletes every chunk and rebuilds from the files
on disk, and the result must be identical to what an incremental run would have
produced. Chunk ids are derived from the memory id and the ordinal for exactly
that reason — a rebuild that renumbered rows would be a different index wearing
the same name.

Incremental work is keyed on the git blob hash of each file. Content that has
not changed is neither re-chunked nor re-embedded, which is the expensive half.
