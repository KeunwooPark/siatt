"""`web_search`, and the boundary it has to hold.

Every other tool returns text Siatt's own code produced. This one returns text
written by whoever runs the sites that ranked, delivered inside a `tool_result`
— a channel that until now has only ever carried the program's own output. The
whole module is arranged around that one difference:

- results are delimited exactly like the untrusted material a consolidation job
  reads, and the model is told so on the line above them;
- nothing from a result can become a memory, because the transcript that
  episode extraction reads is built from text blocks and a tool result is not
  one (`siatt/runner/episodes.py:_render`) — asserted by a test, since it is a
  property of code elsewhere;
- the provider's own error bodies are never echoed back, only its status.

Snippets only. Fetching the page behind a result is `siatt/fetch`, which is a
far larger surface and holds the same boundary in the same shape.
