"""`reorganize`: the weekly librarian pass. Bounded and reversible by construction.

`promote` writes what it is told and `reflect` scores what is there. Neither of
them moves anything, so the shape of the corpus is whatever a year of
one-file-at-a-time decisions left behind: two files about one person, one file
that grew into three subjects, links pointing at ids that were merged away, and
directories nobody can browse.

Four passes, in the order that makes each one see the last one's work:

1. **Repair links.** Deterministic, through the manifest. A memory that was
   merged away keeps its id and its successor records it, so the link still
   resolves — this makes the file say so.
2. **Merge near-duplicates.** Candidate clusters are found deterministically by
   token overlap; whether two memories actually say the same thing is a
   question for a model, asked over the whole of both documents.
3. **Split what grew too big.** Same shape: the candidate is arithmetic, the
   judgement is a model's, and the plan it returns goes through the validator
   like every other plan.
4. **Regenerate the listings.** `memory/README.md` and one per directory, from
   the manifest as it will be *after* the plan.

Two properties this is built to have.

**Bounded.** Model calls per run, memories per cluster, and files per commit,
each capped. A librarian pass that rewrote a thousand files would be
unreviewable, and the whole value of the corpus being in git is that a person
can read what changed.

**Reversible.** One commit per run. `git revert` puts every one of these
decisions back, which is the only reason it is safe to let a model make them —
and it is why nothing here deletes: a merge archives its sources, and their ids
go on resolving through the `supersedes` chain.

MERGE_TASK = """These memories overlap enough that they may be describing the
same thing. Decide whether they are, and if so merge them into one.

`memory_files` holds each of them in full, keyed by path.

Return a JSON array holding **at most one** patch, and only of this form:

`{{"type": "merge", "into": "<the id to keep>", "from_ids": [...the others...],
"body": "<the whole merged body>"}}`

The sources are archived rather than deleted and their ids go on resolving, so
nothing that links to them breaks.

Keep the id of whichever memory is the better home for the merged claim — the
one with the more accurate title, or the older one when there is nothing to
choose between them. `body` replaces it entirely, so write the whole thing.

**No fact may be lost.** Every distinct claim in every source has to appear in
the merged body. If merging them would mean dropping something, or if they are
about genuinely different things that happen to share vocabulary, return `[]`.
`[]` is the right answer far more often than a merge is.

SPLIT_TASK = """This memory has grown to cover more than one subject. One claim
per memory is the rule the corpus is written to, and this file has stopped
following it.

`memory_files` holds it in full.

Return a JSON array of `create` patches — one per subject — followed by a
single `archive` of the original:

`{{"type": "create", "memory": <document>}}`
`{{"type": "archive", "id": "{original}", "reason": "split"}}`

Every part of the original body must end up in exactly one of the new
memories; nothing may be dropped and nothing invented. Give each new memory a
title that says what it is about, and link them to each other with
`[[<id>]]` where the prose refers across.

If the file is long but genuinely about one thing, return `[]`. A long memory
about one subject is not a problem.

Use these ids, each at most once:
{ids}

Set `created` and `updated` to {now}, and `visibility` to exactly `workspace`.
