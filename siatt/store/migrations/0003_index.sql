-- Everything in this file is disposable. `siatt reindex --full` deletes all of it
-- and rebuilds it by walking the repo, and that has to stay true: the moment
-- something durable lives only here, the repo stops being the source of truth
-- and the whole design of this system stops holding.

-- `chunks_vec` (embeddings) arrives with #31; lexical search comes first.
