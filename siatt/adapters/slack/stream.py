"""One Slack message, rewritten while the turn that produces it runs.

A long turn is indistinguishable from a broken one. The thread sits there, and
the person who asked either waits or asks again — and asking again is a second
turn, a second model call, and two answers to one question. A message that
visibly changes is the cheapest fix there is.

The rate at which it changes is the whole design. Slack allows roughly one
`chat.update` per second per channel; a token-by-token rewrite would be
hundreds, so every one after the first would be refused, the client would be
backing off during the part of the turn that matters, and the message would
flicker in every reader's client on the way there. So deltas never call Slack.
They land in a buffer, and a painter task redraws at a fixed interval — the
cost of a turn is the same whether the model emits four tokens or four thousand.

When Slack refuses anyway, the answer is to stop redrawing rather than to try
harder: intermediate frames are a nicety and the final one is the answer, so
under rate-limit pressure this degrades to exactly what it replaced, a single
message with the answer in it.

Frames are droppable but not reorderable. Only one write is ever in flight, and
the answer is written after the last frame has landed rather than on top of one
still on its way — see `_stop_painting` for why cancelling is not enough (#192).

No `slack_sdk` import. What it needs is two calls — post one message, rewrite
one message — and taking them as a protocol is what lets the throttling and
the degradation be tested without a socket or the `slack` extra.
