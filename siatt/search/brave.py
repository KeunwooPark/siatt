"""Brave Search.

Chosen as the first backend because it returns snippets rather than pages: the
result of a call is a few hundred words of somebody else's text, not a document
to be fetched, rendered, and stripped. That keeps both the token cost and the
injection surface small, which is what makes web search shippable ahead of a
`web_fetch` tool rather than alongside one.
