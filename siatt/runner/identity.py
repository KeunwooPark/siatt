"""`identity`: give every Slack user id one `people/` memory, and only one.

`Directory` (in the Slack adapter) learns who somebody is on the turn path and
writes it to SQLite. This is the other half: it moves that mapping into the
corpus, where it is durable, readable, and something a person can correct.

Why a job rather than a write during the turn. A commit takes the memory write
lease and may push; doing that the first time each person speaks would put git
in the middle of a conversation and contend with every consolidation job for
the lease. Batching a sweep is also what makes a workspace's first busy hour
one commit instead of forty.

The two rules it exists to keep:

**One person, one file.** A uid is matched on `source_refs`, never on a name.
Names change — that is the normal case, not the edge case — and a version of
this that matched on the display name would write a second Jane every time Jane
edited her profile, which is exactly the forking #23 is about.

**It owns a block, not a file.** `promote` writes prose about people into these
same files, and a person may edit them by hand. So the generated mapping lives
between two markers and nothing outside them is ever rewritten. Previous names
are not kept in the block either: `git log` is this corpus's audit trail, and
the rename is a diff in it.
