"""Setting up a standing task by asking for one.

#179 gave Siatt a table of standing tasks and a CLI to manage it. That is the
wrong surface for the person it is for: somebody in a Slack thread who says
"do this every weekday morning" should not be told to open a terminal and
write five cron fields.

The translation is the one part of this a model is genuinely good at — "every
weekday at 9am Seoul time" into `0 9 * * 1-5` and `Asia/Seoul` — so the model
does it and the tool validates rather than trusts. `Cron.parse` with the zone,
the interval floor, the per-owner cap: every refusal comes back as a tool error
the model can read and correct, which is what `ToolRegistry` already gives
these for free.

Two constraints shape all three, and they are the same ones the memory tools
work under.

**The session supplies the destination, never the model.** `session_id`,
`channel`, `reply_to`, `scope` and `owner` come off `ToolContext`, which the
turn built from the event. There is no argument for where a task posts, so no
instruction smuggled into text Siatt read can create one that posts anywhere but
the thread it was created in. A task created in a DM stays in the DM (§11.1).

**Listing and cancelling are scoped to the calling session**, for the same
reason: text arriving in one channel must not be able to enumerate or delete
another channel's schedules (§7.1). The narrowing is in the query, not applied
to the results — a tool that read every row and then dropped the ones it should
not show has already had them.

What `schedule_create` returns is the next three fire times, rendered in the
task's own zone. That is the whole confirmation story: nobody can check
`0 9 * * 1-5`, and anybody can check "Mon 08 Sep 09:00 Asia/Seoul".
