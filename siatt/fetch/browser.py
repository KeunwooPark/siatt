"""Rendering a page that draws itself in the browser.

`web_fetch` reads the HTML a site serves. A growing share of the web does not
put its content there — a cinema timetable arrives over XHR after the document
has loaded, and the document says nothing about what is playing. This module is
the other way of getting it: run the page, then read what it drew.

It is a much larger capability than a GET, and the difference is not the
rendering. It is that a browser makes hundreds of requests nobody chose. A
static fetch has one URL per hop to judge; one measured render of a cinema page
made 147, and 5,341 with interception on. So the design is about that number:

- **Every request is judged**, by the same `guard.approve` a static fetch uses,
  and anything it refuses is aborted before it is sent. A bare headless browser
  is a live SSRF — measured, not assumed: it reached a loopback server.
- **Most requests are never made.** Images, media and fonts are aborted on
  resource type alone, before any resolution. They are not reading matter, and
  on that same page they were 5,265 of the 5,341.
- **The document's address is pinned**, with `--host-resolver-rules`, to the one
  the guard approved — the same property `siatt/fetch/client.py` gets by
  connecting to the address it resolved. Chromium obeys the rule and still
  verifies the certificate against the *name*, so the pin costs no TLS.
- **Nothing is operated.** Navigate, wait, read. No clicking, typing, form
  submission, or downloads: a rendered page is full of controls, and the text
  next to them was written by a stranger who would like them pressed.

The context is thrown away after every render, so nothing — cookie, storage,
service worker — survives from one page to the next.

`playwright` is an optional extra and is imported inside the launch, so an
install without it is an install where `[browser] enabled` simply cannot be
turned on, rather than one that fails at import time.
