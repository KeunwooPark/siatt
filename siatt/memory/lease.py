"""The single-writer lease over the long-term memory repo.

Two halves, and both are load-bearing.

The **flock** is the enforcement. It is held by the kernel against an open file
description, so it is released the instant the holder dies — including when the
holder is killed mid-write, which is exactly the case a lock built out of a
database row gets wrong.

The **database row** is the explanation. A flock tells you the lock is taken; it
does not tell you by whom, since when, or for what job, and that is what someone
staring at a stuck daemon actually needs.

Consequently: taking the flock is the decision, the row is written after, and a
row without a live flock is a leftover from a crash rather than a live holder.
