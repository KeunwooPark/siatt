"""A five-field cron expression, and when it next fires.

Small on purpose. The schedules this has to express are the ones in
`docs/DESIGN.md` §6 — hourly, nightly, weekly — and a dependency taken on for
that is a dependency to keep current forever.

Times are UTC unless an expression is given a zone. That default is the right
one for the jobs this was written for: nobody asks what time zone `reindex`
runs in, and `0 3 * * *` in a registration means three in the morning on the
server. It stops being the right one the moment a *person* names a time.
"Nine every morning" is nine where they are, it moves twice a year, and nobody
should have to do the offset arithmetic to say it — so `parse` takes an
optional IANA zone, the walk happens on that zone's wall clock, and only the
answer is converted back. The boundary is unchanged either way: an aware UTC
instant in, an aware UTC instant out.
