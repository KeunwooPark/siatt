"""Keep secret material out of logs and out of model prompts.

Two sources feed this. The first is exact: Siatt knows the names of the
environment variables holding its own credentials, so it knows their values and
can match them literally. The vault is part of that first source — every secret
in it is matched exactly, whether or not any config file refers to it, which is
what makes the vault a containment boundary rather than a filing cabinet. The
second is shape-based, for tokens Siatt was never told about — a key pasted into
a chat message, or one echoed back inside a tool result — matched by the
prefixes the major providers issue and by the header a private key carries.

Neither is a guarantee, and this is not a substitute for not putting secrets
somewhere. It is the net under the times somebody does.

Installed in three places, each of them a boundary where text Siatt did not just
receive from the user leaves for somewhere it cannot be taken back from:
logging handlers, `ToolRegistry` (tool results), and `Retriever` (recalled
memory, which is replayed into the prompt on every turn that retrieves it).
