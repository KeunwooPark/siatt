"""Splitting a memory document into retrievable pieces.

Chunking is where retrieval quality is won or lost, and the tempting mistake is
to cut on a character count. A memory file is already structured — a title, some
tags, prose under headings — so the cuts follow that structure and fall back to
size only when a section is genuinely too long to return whole.

Each chunk carries the salience of the memory it came from. That is
denormalization on purpose: ranking reads it on every row, and a score that
needs a join is one paid for per candidate.
