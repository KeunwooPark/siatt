"""One actor per conversation, with a serialized mailbox.

Two messages arriving in the same thread while the agent is mid-turn must
queue, not interleave into one context window (`docs/DESIGN.md` §3.2). An actor
per session key is what enforces that, and it is the *only* ordering guarantee
in the system: within a session, strictly in order; across sessions, everything
at once.

Actors hold no durable state. Everything a turn needs is already in SQLite, so
an idle actor is dropped rather than kept warm, and the next message for that
session builds another one. That is what makes eviction free, and it is why
`_rehydrate` reads the session row every turn instead of caching it: a cached
copy is a second source of truth that goes stale the moment a background job
touches the same session.
