"""Fixed-allocation, tokenizer-aware context assembly.

Two properties this module exists to guarantee:

1. **The recent turns are never starved.** Each segment gets a share of the
   budget and truncates at its own boundary, so an overlong retrieval cannot
   evict the conversation the user is actually having.
2. **The cacheable prefix is byte-stable.** `system` is built from inputs that
   do not vary turn to turn, and per-turn material goes in `context` instead.
   Prompt caching is worth roughly an order of magnitude on a long session, and
   a single interpolated timestamp in the prefix destroys it.
