"""The boundary around text Siatt did not write.

One implementation, used everywhere untrusted material enters a prompt. The
delimiter is a nonce rather than a fixed tag: a `</transcript>` somebody types
into a channel closes a fence, and cannot close a delimiter it has never seen.

The nonce is not the whole defence, only the part that makes the boundary
unambiguous. What actually contains the content is what sits on the other side
of the call — a consolidation model with no tools whose output is decoded as a
typed patch plan, or, for a tool result, an agent that can write nothing without
going through the same plan.
