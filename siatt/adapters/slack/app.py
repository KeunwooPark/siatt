"""Socket Mode: Slack ingress and egress for a daemon with no public address.

Ingress does exactly one thing — normalize, enqueue, return. Slack gives a
listener three seconds before it treats the event as undelivered and re-sends
it, and bolt acknowledges once the listener returns, so anything slow on this
path becomes a retry storm on top of whatever was already slow. The agent runs
behind the queue, where taking a minute costs nothing.
