"""The jobs table, the loop that drains it, and the clock that fills it.

Jobs are rows, not in-memory timers. A restart loses nothing, a job whose
process died runs again when its lease expires, and a second worker is another
drainer over the same table rather than a redesign.

The clock half is deliberately dumb: every tick, each recurring job's *next*
occurrence is inserted under an id derived from its fire time, which makes the
insert idempotent and the whole thing safe to run twice. It also means a
scheduler that was down over a fire time does not stampede on restart — the
occurrence it had already queued still runs, late, and the ones it never
queued never happened.
