-- v3: durable background execution.
--
-- Jobs are rows rather than in-memory timers, which is the whole point: a
-- restart loses nothing, a crashed job's lease expires and it runs again, and
-- the same table extends to an out-of-process worker without a redesign —
-- a second worker is another drainer over these rows.
--
-- The same lease/attempt/dead-letter shape as `inbox`, deliberately, but not
-- the same table. The inbox dedupes on a provider's event id and never
-- schedules; a job schedules and never dedupes on anything external. What the
-- two genuinely share is the loop over them, and that lives in
-- `siatt/core/drain.py` rather than in a table one of them does not fit.
