"""What a surface delivered, in the one shape the rest of Siatt understands.

An adapter's whole job at ingress is to turn a provider's event into an
`InboundEvent` and enqueue it. Everything downstream — the dispatcher, the
session router, the agent loop — sees only this type, so adding a surface never
means teaching the core about another payload shape.

It is also what sits in `inbox.payload`, which makes the queue self-describing:
a row that replays after a restart carries everything needed to answer it, and
a row that cannot be parsed is a row this version does not know how to answer
rather than one it will half-answer.
