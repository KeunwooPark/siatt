"""The half that needs a real browser.

Marked `browser` and deselected by default, because CI does not install 650MB
of Chromium to prove that Chromium works. What it does prove is the two claims
`siatt/fetch/browser.py` rests on and cannot check against a fake:

- `--host-resolver-rules` is obeyed, so the pin is real rather than decorative;
- a certificate is still verified against the *name* under that pin, so the pin
  costs no TLS.

Run with `uv run pytest -m browser` on a machine where
`uv run playwright install chromium` has been run.
