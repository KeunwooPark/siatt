"""The generated listings: `memory/README.md` and one per directory.

The repo is meant to be opened by a person. A directory holding two hundred
files named after slugs is not something anybody browses, so `reorganize`
regenerates an index beside them — the human entry point the design asks for
(§4.5).

Generated from the manifest and never by a model. These are the one place in
`memory/` where a file is not somebody's claim about the world, which is why
`is_machinery` refuses them to patch plans and why the manifest and the search
index walk past them instead of reporting them as files that will not parse.

The listing is rebuilt whole every time, so nothing accumulates in it and a
memory that went away leaves nothing behind. Anything written above the marker
in `memory/README.md` is kept: it is the front page of somebody's repository,
and a job that erased the paragraph they wrote at the top of it every week is a
job they turn off.
