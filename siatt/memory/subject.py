"""One normalized key per entity, so the same thing groups across episodes.

`observations.subject` is a grouping key, not a label. `promote` collects every
pending observation about one subject and asks the model to reconcile them
against long-term memory in a single pass, and that only works if two people
saying the same name in two different conversations land on the same string.

Deliberately deterministic and deliberately dull. A model-driven entity
resolver would group better and would also mean the grouping changed under you
between runs; this one can be reasoned about, tested, and read in a diff. The
harder cases — "Jane" and "Jane Doe" being the same person — are for the
retrieval step in `promote`, which sees the existing corpus and can tell.
