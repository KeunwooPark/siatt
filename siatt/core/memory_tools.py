"""The agent's own access to long-term memory.

Pre-injected retrieval handles the common case at no extra latency, and it will
still miss — someone asks about a memory whose wording shares nothing with the
question, or asks a second question the first retrieval did not anticipate.
These three tools are the tail, and shipping both is the point: injection covers
the ninety percent, tools cover the rest.

Two constraints shape all of them:

- **Scope comes from the session, never from the model.** A tool argument that
  could widen visibility would make every other scope check decorative.
- **`memory_write` does not write.** It appends an observation, and the
  `promote` job turns observations into a validated patch plan. The interactive
  path and the background path therefore share one write path — the one that
  has been through the patch validator.
