"""The lease, and the difference between "taken" and "cannot be taken".

`flock` has two quite different failure modes and one return value for both.
`EAGAIN` means somebody else holds the lock, which is the answer the lease is
asking for. Everything else means the lock did not happen — `ENOLCK` from NFS
without a lock daemon, `ENOSYS` and `EINVAL` from some FUSE mounts — and
reading that as "somebody else holds it" makes the whole mechanism a no-op that
reports success.
