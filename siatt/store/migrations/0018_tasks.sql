-- v5: schedules a person created, rather than ones compiled in.
--
-- Every recurring thing Siatt did before this was a `JobSpec` in
-- `default_specs` — written by whoever built the binary, and unchangeable by
-- whoever uses it. A row here is the other kind: someone said "every weekday at
-- nine, tell me what happened overnight", and this is where that lives.
--
-- The table is deliberately not `jobs`. A job is one run; a task is the
-- standing intent that produces runs, and it outlives every one of them. The
-- clock reads this table and writes `jobs` rows, so the two keep the roles they
-- already had: this one remembers, that one executes.
--
-- What is *not* here is anywhere for the task to post. `channel`, `reply_to`,
-- `scope` and `session_id` are copied from the conversation that created the
-- task and are never settable afterwards (§11.1). A task inherits the
-- visibility of the thread it was asked for in, so text arriving in a DM
-- cannot arrange for anything to be said in a public channel.
