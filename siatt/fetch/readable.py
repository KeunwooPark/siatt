"""HTML to the words a reader would have seen.

Not a renderer and not trying to be. What a turn needs from a page is the text
in reading order, small enough to sit in a context window beside everything
else — so this drops what a reader never sees (scripts, styles, metadata),
keeps the block structure that tells a heading from a paragraph, and stops at a
character budget rather than letting one long page evict the conversation.

`html.parser` rather than a parser dependency, deliberately. The input is
hostile by assumption, and the standard library's parser has one job here:
turn tags into events. Nothing is executed, no resource is loaded, and no
element's content is trusted — the output goes behind `siatt/untrusted.py`
either way.

#: Elements whose text is markup, styling, or metadata rather than reading
#: matter. Everything between the open and close tag is dropped.
#:
#: `head` is not among them, because `<title>` is in it and the title is often
#: the most useful line on the page. Nothing else in a head carries text: the
#: two that do, `script` and `style`, are silenced by name.
#:
#: `form` is not among them either, and used to be. A form is a container, not
#: a kind of content, and silencing a container silences whatever somebody put
#: inside it — which on an ASP.NET WebForms page is the whole body, since the
#: framework wraps `<body>` in one `<form runat="server">`. Such a page came
#: back with no text in it, and a page with no text in it is refused, so the
#: model was told the URL had nothing readable on it when it had a whole
#: article. What was actually unwanted is `select`: a closed dropdown shows one
#: line, and a reader never sees the other two hundred country names.
