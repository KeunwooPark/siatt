"""Reading a web page, and the boundary that makes it safe to.

`guard` decides where a request may go, `client` sends it and bounds what comes
back, `readable` turns a page into words, and `tool` hands those words to the
model behind `siatt/untrusted.py`'s delimiter. `browser` is the other way of
getting the HTML, for pages that draw themselves — same guard, same extraction,
same boundary, and a much larger bill. Nothing here trusts anything it reads,
including the URL it was given.
