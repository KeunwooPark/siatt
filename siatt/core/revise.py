"""When the conversation changes under a memory that was built from it.

Short-term memory is a copy of a transcript, and a copy is only honest while
the original still says the same thing. Slack lets anybody edit or delete what
they said an hour ago, and a system that remembers on purpose has to have an
answer for that beyond keeping the old words.

Three things happen to a revised message, and they are deliberately different
from each other:

**The message itself** is rewritten in place — new words for an edit, a
tombstone for a deletion. In place rather than removed: the assistant has
already answered it, that answer is still in the transcript, and a reply to a
message that is no longer there reads as the model having invented the
question.

**Candidate facts drawn from it** are treated by what the change means. An edit
says the words this claim was read out of are not the words that were said, so
the claim is stale — it was never promoted, and it should not be. A deletion is
weaker evidence than that: somebody retracting a message may be correcting a
typo, may have thought better of saying it out loud, or may simply have
finished with it. So a deletion lowers confidence and lets `promote` weigh the
claim against everything else that was said, rather than settling it here.

**Anything already in the repo** is left exactly as it is, and a review is
queued instead. A background job that quietly deletes a file because somebody
removed a Slack message an hour later is the behaviour the whole patch-plan
pipeline exists to prevent: the memory may have been merged, rewritten or built
on since, and a retraction is not a correction. Siatt says what it noticed and
stops.

Surface-agnostic on purpose. Slack is what motivates it, and every surface that
lets a person take something back needs the same three answers.
