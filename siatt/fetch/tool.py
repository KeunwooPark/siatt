"""`web_fetch`, and the boundary it inherits.

The second tool that puts a stranger's words inside a `tool_result`, and by far
the larger of the two: a search result is a snippet somebody else already
summarized, while this is a whole page, chosen by the model, from an address
the model supplied. It is held by the same three things `web_search` is held by
and one more:

- the page arrives inside `siatt/untrusted.py`'s nonce-delimited block, with the
  notice on the line above it;
- nothing in it can become a memory, because the transcript episode extraction
  reads is built from text blocks and a tool result is not one
  (`siatt/runner/episodes.py:_render`) — a property of code elsewhere, so it is
  asserted by a test;
- no response body is ever echoed as an error, only what went wrong;
- and where the request may go at all is decided by `siatt/fetch/guard.py`
  before a byte is sent, on every hop.

The tool takes a URL and nothing else. No headers, no method, no body: each one
would be a way for the model to turn a reader into a client of something, and
none of them is needed to read a page.
