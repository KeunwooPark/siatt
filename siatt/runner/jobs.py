"""The jobs Siatt actually knows how to run.

All of `docs/DESIGN.md` §6 is here now. Adding another changes nothing else
about the machinery: a job is a `JobSpec` with a handler and, if it runs on its
own, a cron.

What a spec is registered *on* is what this module decides, and the conditions
differ. `episode_close` needs a model and no repo — it writes to SQLite, and it
is what fills the queue `promote` drains. `reindex` and `forget` need a repo
and no model; `forget` in particular has no judgement in it at all, which is
deliberate for the one job that removes things. `promote`, `reflect` and
`reorganize` need both. A build with neither registers nothing, which is why
`siatt job list` still works on a machine with no API key.
