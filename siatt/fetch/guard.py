"""Where a fetch is allowed to go, decided before a byte is sent.

`web_fetch` takes a URL from a model that read it in somebody else's web page.
That makes the address itself attacker-influenced, and the machine Siatt runs on
is a long-running daemon on somebody's network with a cloud metadata service, a
Slack token in its environment, and an SQLite file next to it. The interesting
target of an SSRF is never the internet; it is `169.254.169.254`, `localhost`,
and the 10/8 nobody firewalled from itself.

So the guard is not a blocklist of hostnames. It resolves the name and judges
the *addresses*, which is the only thing that survives a redirect chain, a
`0x7f.1`, a `[::ffff:127.0.0.1]`, and a domain whose A record is public on the
first lookup and `127.0.0.1` on the second. And because the check and the
connection would otherwise be two different resolutions, `approve` hands back
the address it approved and the fetcher connects to that — the name is never
resolved twice.
