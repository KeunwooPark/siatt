"""Rendering: which requests are made, and which are refused.

No browser. What is worth asserting about this module is its policy — the
resource types it never fetches, the addresses it aborts, the caps that stop a
page spending a turn — and none of that needs 650MB of Chromium. `Launcher` is
a protocol for exactly this reason.

`test_browser_live.py` is the other half, marked `browser`, and runs a real one.
