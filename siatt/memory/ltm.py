"""The write path to long-term memory.

This is the only component in Siatt that can destroy something a person cannot
get back, so it is built around three rules that are not negotiable:

- **Never force-push.** History is the undo buffer. Everything else in this
  design — "delete is reversible", "you can revert a bad belief" — is a
  consequence of that one line, and a single `--force` erases all of it.
- **Delete is `git rm`.** The blob stays reachable forever.
- **Never destroy uncommitted work.** A working copy left dirty by a crashed run
  gets stashed, not reset. A stash is recoverable; a person's hand edits to a
  memory file are not.

Everything runs under the single-writer lease (see `lease.py`), because two
daemons pushing concurrently is the one way to lose data here.
