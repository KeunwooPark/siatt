"""What happens downstream when somebody takes back what they said.

Three different answers to three different events, and the test names say which
is which: an edit invalidates a claim, a deletion weakens one, and neither of
them touches the repo. The last is the one worth being strict about — a
background job that quietly deletes a file because a Slack message went away an
hour later is the behaviour the patch-plan pipeline exists to prevent.
