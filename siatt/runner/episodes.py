"""`episode_close`: turn a stretch of conversation into candidate facts.

The first half of the STM → LTM pipeline (`docs/DESIGN.md` §6). A conversation
arrives as messages; this is what decides that a segment of it is over, writes
down what it was about, and distills it into atomic observations that `promote`
can reconcile against the corpus.

Three things it is careful about.

**The transcript is untrusted.** It is text somebody typed into a channel, and
it is going into a prompt, so it travels in the nonce-delimited block from
`siatt.memory.consolidate` (#30). The load-bearing defence is on the other side:
the extractor's output is a list of claims, validated against a schema, and a
claim is not an instruction anybody acts on. Nothing here can write a file, and
`promote` — which can — never sees this text.

**Scope is inherited.** An observation's visibility comes from the session row,
never from the model. A conversation held in a DM produces private
observations, whatever the model would prefer.

**Most conversations are not worth extracting from.** Every closed episode is
scored — "did anything worth remembering happen here?" — and one below the
threshold closes with its summary and no observations, so it never reaches
`promote` at all (§6.1). The score rides along on the summary call rather than
costing a call of its own: the summary happens either way, so the gate is free
and what it saves is the extraction *and* everything downstream of it. An
explicit `memory_write` is never gated — it is already somebody deciding.

**An episode is never left half-closed.** The close and the observations it
produced commit together, so a crash cannot leave a closed episode whose facts
were never written — nothing reopens an episode, so those facts would be gone.
A model that will not produce a usable extraction for this particular
conversation still closes it, loudly, rather than leaving a segment the sweep
picks up and pays for again every five minutes.

`summary`: three sentences at most, for someone who was not there. Say what was

that you are summarizing.

`signal_score`: did anything worth remembering beyond this conversation happen
here? Score it from 0 to 1:

- 0.0-0.2 — nothing durable. Greetings, thanks, scheduling this afternoon,
  a question answered from what was already known, chatter.
- 0.3-0.6 — something new but small. A detail about a person or a project, a
  correction, a pointer somebody would want again later.
- 0.7-1.0 — a decision, a commitment, a change of ownership, a standing
  preference, or a correction to something previously believed.

Score the conversation you were given, not the one you would like to have been
given. Most conversations score low, and that is the answer.

`reason`: one clause saying why, so a person tuning the threshold can read it.

EXTRACT_SYSTEM = f"""You extract durable facts from one segment of a conversation.

A good observation is atomic, self-contained, and still true next month. Someone
reading it a year from now, with no access to this conversation, should
understand it.

Rules:
- One claim per observation. Split "Jane owns deploys and is on leave" in two.
- Write the claim as a full sentence that names its subject. "Owns the deploy
  pipeline" is useless on its own; "Jane Doe owns the deploy pipeline" is not.
- `subject` is the entity the claim is about — a person, a project, a topic.
  Use the fullest name the conversation gives for it, consistently.
- Cite the transcript line numbers the claim comes from, in `source_lines`.
- Extract nothing about the conversation itself: not that a question was asked,
  not that you answered it, not that somebody said thanks.
- Skip anything transient — what someone is doing this afternoon, what the
  weather is, what a command printed.
- If nothing in the segment is worth remembering, return an empty list. That is
  a normal answer and by far the most common one.
