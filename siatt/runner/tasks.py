"""Standing tasks: a schedule somebody created, delivered as an ordinary turn.

Every recurring thing Siatt did before this was compiled in. `default_specs`
(`siatt/runner/jobs.py`) is a list written by whoever built the binary, and the
clock iterates exactly that list — so there was no way for a person to say
"every weekday at nine, tell me what happened in AI overnight" and have it
happen. A standing task is that: a row someone created, fired by the daemon,
answered in the thread they created it in.

The interesting claim in this module is how little it adds.

* The clock already queues occurrences under an id derived from their fire
  time (`scheduled_id`), which is what makes it idempotent, safe to run twice,
  and free of a stampede after downtime. A task's occurrences use the same
  trick, so none of that is re-reasoned here.
* The handler does **not** run the agent. It builds an `InboundEvent` and puts
  it in the inbox. From there it is an ordinary turn — dispatcher, session
  actor, context packing, retrieval, tools, and the surface's own reply path —
  and no adapter needs to learn anything: Slack answers from `event.channel`
  and `event.reply_to` alone.
* `UNIQUE (source, external_id)` on the inbox is what stops a *retried job*
  producing a second answer. The job's own id is the event's `external_id`, so
  the two queues' at-least-once semantics compose into at-most-one-answer
  without a new mechanism.

The destination is never a parameter. `session_id`, `channel`, `reply_to` and
`scope` are copied from the conversation that created the task and are fixed
there (§11.1): a task inherits the visibility of the thread it was asked for
in, so nothing arriving in a DM can arrange to be said in a public channel.
