"""Leasing work out of a durable queue, and guaranteeing it comes back.

Two queues need this. The inbox (#19) hands out messages to answer; the job
queue (#26) hands out consolidation passes. What they share is not their SQL —
one dedupes on a provider's event id and never schedules, the other schedules
and never dedupes — but the loop over it: lease a bounded batch, hold the
leases for as long as the work runs, and make sure every leased row reaches
exactly one of complete, fail or release.

Keeping that in one place is also what makes the design's promise cheap: an
out-of-process worker is another `Drainer` over the same table, because
nothing here assumes it is the only one except `reclaim_on_start`, which says
so.
