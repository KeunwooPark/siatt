"""`promote`: move distilled knowledge from SQLite into the git repo.

The job that makes the product exist. Everything before it accumulates
candidate facts in a database nobody reads; this is what turns them into files
a person can open, disagree with, and revert.

The shape of one run:

1. Read the pending observations and group them by `(subject, scope)`. The pair
   rather than the subject, because two visibility scopes must never meet
   inside one prompt — a group is reconciled as a unit, and the unit inherits
   one audience.
2. For each group, retrieve the memories already in the corpus that compete
   with it. This is the step that makes a restated fact an *update* instead of
   a second file saying the same thing.
3. Ask the chat model for a typed patch plan over that group.
4. Compile every accepted plan and apply them as **one commit**.
5. Mark the observations promoted or discarded, with the reason recorded.

Three rules it is built around.

**The model proposes; deterministic code disposes.** The reply is a JSON array
of patches and nothing else — it cannot mark an observation, choose a path, or
touch git. `promote` may not emit `Delete` at all, which `PatchCompiler`
enforces rather than trusts (#13); only `forget` deletes, and only what is
already archived.

**Visibility is inherited.** Every group carries one scope, retrieval is
filtered to it, and a plan that sets anything else on a document it creates is
corrected to the group's scope before compiling — loudly, because a model
getting that wrong is worth knowing about, and rejecting the plan over it would
lose the fact instead.

**Re-running is a no-op.** Idempotence comes from the observations table: a run
that commits marks its inputs `promoted`, and the next run finds nothing
pending. A crash between the commit and the marking re-promotes, and the model
sees its own memory in the competition and updates it rather than duplicating —
which is why the competition step is not only about quality.

#: Fresh ids offered to the model per group, on top of one per observation. A
#: `Create` needs an id that passes `Frontmatter._valid_id`, and a model asked
#: to invent a ULID produces something that fails validation often enough to
#: matter. Handing it valid ones costs nothing and removes the failure mode.
SPARE_IDS = 2

#: What the output budget is multiplied by when a reply comes back with no plan
#: in it. A model that ran out of room is not a model that disagreed, and
#: `max_attempts` is there to stop a group whose *content* cannot be planned —
#: spending three runs, an hour apart, discovering that the budget was the
#: problem loses the facts to a number this job chose. One retry at twice the

RETRY_FACTOR = 2

TASK = """Reconcile these candidate observations about one subject against what
long-term memory already says.

`channel_messages` holds the observations, one per line, numbered. Each is a
claim distilled from a conversation. `memory_files` holds the memories already
in the corpus that compete with them, keyed by path — these are what you are
reconciling against, and updating one of them is almost always better than
writing another file about the same thing.

Return a JSON array of patch objects. The allowed operations are:

- `{{"type": "create", "memory": {{"frontmatter": {{"id": "<memory id>",
  "type": "fact", "title": "<title>", "tags": [], "visibility": "<scope>",
  "created": "<timestamp>", "updated": "<timestamp>"}}, "body": "<prose>"}},
  "path": "memory/<dir>/<slug>.md"}}` — a subject the corpus says nothing about
  yet. The frontmatter fields must be nested under `memory.frontmatter`; they
  are not fields of `memory` itself. `path` is optional; omit it and the
  conventional path for the document's `type` is used.
- `{{"type": "update", "id": "<memory id>", "body": "<full new body>",
  "frontmatter": {{...}}}}` — the corpus already covers this subject. `body`
  replaces the old body entirely, so write the whole thing, not the change.
  `frontmatter` carries only the fields you are changing. Never include `id`,
  `created`, or `updated` in an update's frontmatter: identity and creation time
  are immutable, and Siatt stamps `updated` automatically. Omit `frontmatter`
  when only the body changes.
- `{{"type": "merge", "into": "<memory id>", "from_ids": [...], "body": "..."}}`
  — two existing memories say the same thing. The sources are archived, not
  deleted, and their ids keep resolving.
- `{{"type": "supersede", "old_id": "<memory id>", "new": <document>}}` — the
  new claim contradicts an existing memory rather than extending it. The old
  one is archived and the new one records that it replaced it.

There is no delete. Nothing you return can remove a memory.

Return raw JSON only, with no Markdown or code fences. Return `[]` when the
corpus already says everything these observations say.
That is a normal answer, and it is the right one for a restated fact whose
memory is already accurate.

Write for a person reading the file in a year. One claim per memory; split
rather than append when a file starts covering two subjects.

Use these ids for any memory you create, each at most once:
{ids}

Set `created` and `updated` to {now} on anything you create.
Set `visibility` to exactly `{scope}` on anything you create. Every observation
here came from a conversation with that audience, and a memory may not be
written to a wider one.
