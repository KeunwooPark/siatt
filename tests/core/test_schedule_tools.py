"""Setting up a standing task by asking for one.

The tools are thin over `Tasks`, which #179 already covers. What is worth
testing here is the seam: that the destination comes off the session and
cannot be reached from a tool argument, that the confirmation is something a
person can check, and that a refusal comes back as something the model can
correct rather than as a dead turn.
