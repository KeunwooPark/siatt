"""`reflect`: the nightly pass that keeps long-term memory coherent.

`promote` makes the corpus grow. Nothing in it makes the corpus stay *good*, and
a memory that only ever accumulates becomes an archive nobody can find anything
in. This is the counterweight, and it does three things a night.

**It writes the day down.** `journal/YYYY/MM/DD.md` is a digest of what was
talked about, built from the day's episode summaries. Workspace-scoped
summaries only: the journal is a file in a repo the whole workspace can read,
and a DM summarized into it is a private conversation published.

**It recomputes salience.** Every memory decays; one that was actually recalled
into a conversation is boosted. That is the number `forget` (#34) will read, so
it is computed here, deterministically, and written through the same validated
patch path as everything else — the arithmetic lives in `siatt/memory/salience.py`
where it can be read without a scheduler around it.

**It looks for contradictions, and does not resolve them.** Two memories about
the same thing that cannot both be true are surfaced in the journal and in the
digest. Neither file is touched. "Prefer the newest" is already what retrieval
does — it scores recency — and a job that silently rewrote the older one would
be destroying the evidence that there was ever a disagreement. A person reads
the journal and decides.

The bounds matter here more than anywhere. A corpus of a thousand memories
cannot have every salience rewritten in one commit, and should not: the cap is
per run, the most out-of-date are done first, and the rest converge over the
following nights. Salience being a few days stale costs nothing; a nightly
thousand-file commit costs a person their ability to read the log.
