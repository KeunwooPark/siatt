"""Rendering a retrieval trace for `siatt why`.

Every quality complaint about a memory system bottoms out in "why did it not
remember X", and the only honest answer is the whole pipeline: what was
searched for, what came back, what each scoring step did to it, what the scope
filter removed, and what actually fitted in the budget.

Rendering lives here rather than in the CLI so that the same trace can be shown
in a terminal now and in a Slack thread later without the explanation being
rewritten twice.
