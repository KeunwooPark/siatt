"""Tool registry and dispatch.

Dispatch never raises into the agent loop. A bad argument, an unknown tool, or a
handler that blows up all come back as a `tool_result` marked `is_error`, so the
model sees the failure and can correct it. Killing the turn instead would strand
an assistant `tool_use` with no matching result, which is unrecoverable state.

It does distinguish them in the log, though. A `SiattError` is a failure this
codebase chose to describe — a site that answered 500, a URL the guard refused
— and it gets one line. Anything else is a bug here and gets a traceback.
