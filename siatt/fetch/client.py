"""One GET, bounded in every dimension that can be made to grow.

A fetch is the only thing in Siatt that opens a connection to an address a model
chose. Everything here is a bound on what that can cost or reach:

- where — every hop re-judged by `guard.approve`, and connected to the address
  the guard approved rather than to a second resolution of the same name;
- how far — a small redirect limit, since a chain is a chain of chances to be
  sent somewhere else;
- how long — one timeout for the whole thing, not per-hop, so a chain of slow
  redirects cannot outlast the turn that is waiting for it;
- how big — the body is read in chunks against a byte cap and abandoned when it
  is reached, so `Content-Length: 12` in front of a gigabyte costs one buffer;
- what — a content-type allowlist, because an executable is not reading matter
  and a 200 that returns one is not a page.

Nothing this daemon knows travels outbound. No cookies are kept between hops,
no `Authorization` is ever set, and the model cannot name a header — a fetch
carries a `User-Agent`, an `Accept`, and nothing else.
