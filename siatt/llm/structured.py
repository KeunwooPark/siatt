"""Asking a model for a typed answer, and refusing to believe it until it is one.

Every consolidation job needs the same thing: a model call whose result is a
validated Pydantic object rather than prose somebody has to parse. The schema
goes in the system prompt — stable across calls, so it stays cacheable — and
the material goes in the user turn.

Two things this deliberately does not do. It does not use any provider's
native JSON mode: those are spelled differently on each side of
`siatt/llm/*_compat.py`, and a provider's representation leaking past that
boundary is the one thing `siatt/llm/types.py` exists to prevent. And it does
not trust the result. `parse_json_object` is lenient about what surrounds the
JSON — models fence it, preface it, apologize after it — and the Pydantic model
is strict about what is inside it, which is the split that matters: the
leniency is about formatting, never about content.

One repair attempt, and only one. A model that cannot produce the shape twice
is not going to produce it on the third try, and the caller has a decision to
make about the episode rather than a retry to spend.
