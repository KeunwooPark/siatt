"""Repairing wikilinks through the manifest.

A memory that was merged away keeps its id: the successor records it in
`supersedes`, and `Manifest.resolve` follows the chain, so a link to the old id
still lands somewhere at read time. What it does not do is fix the file. Six
months of reorganizing leaves a corpus whose links all still work and none of
which say what they point at, which is a corpus nobody can read.

This is the repair, and it is deliberately narrow. A link is rewritten only
when the manifest can say what it *became* — the successor's own id. A link
that resolves to nothing at all is not repairable through the manifest, so it
is reported and left exactly as somebody wrote it. Guessing at it would mean
editing prose to remove a pointer that may be the only record that the thing
ever existed.
