#: sitting in, and that is the *only* whitespace it is allowed to touch.

#: Slack channel ids are prefixed by kind, and a one-to-one conversation with
#: the bot is `D`. Derived from the id rather than from `channel_type`, which
#: only one of the two deliveries carries: a mention in a DM arrives as both
#: `message` (with `channel_type: "im"`) and `app_mention` (without it), under
#: one `ts` and therefore one dedupe key — so whichever landed first decided
#: whether the conversation was private, and which one that was is a race.

#: Subtypes that are still somebody talking. Slack puts a `subtype` on a

#: topic change, a pin.
#:
#: Named rather than excluded, because silence stays the default. Siatt answers
#: in any thread it is already part of, so a denylist would answer every
#: unknown subtype that turned up in one, and "Bob joined the channel" is not a
#: question. The cost of an allowlist is that the next subtype carrying a
