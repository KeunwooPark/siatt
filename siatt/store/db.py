    """Mutual exclusion over the connection, re-entrant within one task.

    `aiosqlite` runs every statement on a single worker thread, which is easy
    to mistake for serialization. It is not: a coroutine yields between
    `execute` and `fetchall`, and again when a cursor closes, so two tasks
    sharing a connection interleave *inside* each other's statements. SQLite
    then refuses the commit that lands there —

        OperationalError: cannot commit transaction - SQL statements in progress

    — which is #101, and it is what a second concurrent conversation produced
    within a couple of hundred messages.

    It stayed hidden for as long as nothing ran two turns at once. It is also
    not only about commits: `append_message` reads `MAX(seq) + 1` and then
    inserts it, and that pair is correct only while nothing else appends to
    the same session in between.

    So the rule is the blunt one: every `Store` method is serialized against
    every other. The statements are microseconds against a model call that
    takes seconds, and WAL still lets a *separate* connection read throughout.

    Re-entrant because the compound methods are written in terms of the simple
    ones — `add_observation` looks up its session, `append_messages` appends
    one at a time — and a plain lock would deadlock on the first of them.
