"""Where a fetch may go.

Every test here is an address somebody would like Siatt to connect to. The guard
is the only thing between a URL a model read off a web page and a socket on the
network this daemon runs on, so the cases are written as the attack rather than
as the branch: `localhost`, the metadata service, the same thing spelled in
IPv6, and a name that answers with one of each.
