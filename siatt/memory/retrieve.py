"""Hybrid retrieval: query, candidates, fusion, scope filter, pack.

The lexical half remains good enough to be useful on its own, because a memory
system that only works once embeddings are configured is a memory system that
does not work.

It has one known blind spot, and it is the ordinary one for lexical search:
derivational morphology. Porter stemming turns "deploying" into "deploy" but
leaves "deployments" alone, so a memory about the "deploy pipeline" does not
answer "who handles deployments?". Inflection is handled; word formation is not.
That gap is the case for #31 rather than for a bigger stopword list.

Two things here are not merely engineering preferences:

**The scope filter runs in SQL, before ranking.** Not after fusion, not during
packing. A memory the requester may not see must never enter the ranked pool at
all, because every later step is a place somebody could forget to re-check. The
one exception is `explain=True`, which re-runs the query unfiltered purely to
report what was excluded — and marks those rows so they cannot be packed.

**Every step is recorded.** Retrieval you cannot debug is retrieval you cannot
improve, and essentially every complaint about this system will arrive as "why
did it not remember X". `siatt why` prints what this module recorded.

**Recalled text is scrubbed on the way out.** A secret that reaches long-term
memory is replayed to the provider on every turn that retrieves it, so the
redactor belongs on this boundary and not only on the tool path — see `scrub`
on `Retriever` and #67.
