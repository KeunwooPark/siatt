"""Who a Slack user id belongs to, cached, and readable in the transcript.

Two jobs, one cache.

The first is that `<@U0456>` is not a name. It reaches the model as an opaque
id, so a thread where three people are discussed reads as a thread where three
identifiers are discussed, and nothing the agent later remembers about any of
them can be matched to the person in the next conversation. Resolving mentions
before the turn is what makes the transcript say what the room said.

The second is the mapping itself: one `people/<slug>.md` per person, holding
`slack://<team>/<user>`, so a DM and a channel are two conversations with the
same person rather than two people. This module only records what it saw;
`siatt.runner.identity` is what writes the memory, on a job, off the turn path.

No `slack_bolt` import, and no web client: the lookup arrives as a callable.
That keeps the whole of it testable on an install that never asked for the
`slack` extra, which is the same reason `events.py` holds no socket.
