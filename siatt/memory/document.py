"""A long-term memory document: YAML frontmatter, Markdown body.

The frontmatter is a contract; the body is prose. That split runs through the
whole module. Frontmatter is parsed into a validated model and **re-serialized
canonically**, so a hundred files written by a model over six months all look
the same in a diff. The body is passed through **byte for byte**, because a
person is going to open these files and rewrite them, and an agent that
reflows someone's paragraphs is an agent they stop trusting with the file.

Parsing is deliberately permissive about YAML — people hand-edit these — and
strict about the resulting values.
